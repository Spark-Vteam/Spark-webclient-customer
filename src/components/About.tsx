              This is a project at Blekinge Institute of Technology in the course of web development
              in virtual teams. The project involves developing a system for the company Spark,
              which rents electric scooters in various cities in Sweden. The company operates in
              three cities and plans to expand to more in the future with the help of the new system
              being developed by the students. The system will handle the logistics of scooter
              rentals, including the availability of scooters, the location of each scooter, and the
              management of customer accounts.
